Title: Rerun 'Magrittr' Pipelines
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Jonathan", "Sidi", email = "yonicd@gmail.com", role = c("aut",
         "cre"))
Description: Functions in a 'magrittr' pipeline are evaluated sequentially making it
         impossible to rerun them directly from the end of the pipeline, while preserving 
         stochastic characteristics embedded within the pipeline. This package 
         allows the user to rerun pipelines using natural 'magrittr' syntax.
